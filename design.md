The program uses linked lists and set array's to iterate through a .JSON file ONLY, search for a keyword, and return all articles which reference that key word. 
In addition to this, I am using the JSON class to parse and store JSON objects to another linked list. 
By doing this, I am saving time from storing unnecessary records, and am able to retain the important string variables such as the "TITLE" and the "REFERENCES".
